      <h5 class="heading-4">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h5>
      <p class="paragraph-3">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#x27;s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br><br>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br><br>• Users can visit our site anonymously. <br>• Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br>• Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &#x27;Privacy&#x27; and can easily be found on the page specified above.<br><br>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:      <br><br>• On our Privacy Policy Page or via email<br><br>You can change your personal information:      <br>• By submitting a request or logging into your billing area.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-3">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.

This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
      <h5 class="heading-4">CAN SPAM Act</h5>
      <p class="paragraph-3">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.<br><br>We collect your email address in order to:     <br><br>• Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions      <br>• Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.      <br>• Send you additional information related to your product and/or service<br><br>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:      <br><br>• Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.      <br>• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.      <br>• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.      <br>• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.      <br>• Honour opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.      <br>• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.<br><br>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us on our <a href="contact.html" class="page-link">contact page</a> and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>
